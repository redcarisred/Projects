# Credit Card Machine Learning Project

This is my first machine learning project. I use a decision tree model to predict whether or not a user will exit a bank within the next year by looking at several factors. Some factors include the user's credit score, their age, whether or not they currently own a credit card, and their estimated salary. 

I tried changing the maximum depth of the decision tree to see if I could maximize the accuracy of the model. I found that a maximum depth of 8 layers worked the best, with an accuracy of ~0.86. In the future, I would like to try looking at other statistics such as the precision, recall, specificity, or f-score in order to maximize the performance of my model.
