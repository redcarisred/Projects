# Credit Card Project

This machine learning algorithm predicts whether or not a user will exit a bank within the next year by looking at several factors. Some factors include the user's credit score, their age, whether or not they currently own a credit card, and their estimated salary.

When the algorithm was scored for accuracy by using a set of randomly selected testing data, it obtained a percentage of 98%.
